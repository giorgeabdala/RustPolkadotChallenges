# Challenge 8: Lifetimes - Reference Validity

**Estimated Time:** 40 minutes  
**Difficulty:** Beginner  
**Topics:** Lifetimes, Lifetime Annotations, References

## Learning Objectives

By completing this challenge, you will understand:
- What lifetimes are and why they exist
- How to read basic lifetime annotations
- When lifetime annotations are required
- Common lifetime patterns

## Background

Lifetimes ensure that references are valid for as long as needed. Most of the time, Rust can infer lifetimes automatically, but sometimes you need to specify them explicitly to help the compiler understand the relationships between references.

## Challenge

Create a simple text analyzer that demonstrates lifetime management with references.

### Requirements

1. **Create functions with explicit lifetimes:**
   - `longest<'a>(x: &'a str, y: &'a str) -> &'a str`
   - `first_word<'a>(s: &'a str) -> &'a str`

2. **Create a `TextAnalyzer<'a>` struct** with:
   - `text: &'a str`

3. **Implement methods:**
   - `TextAnalyzer::new(text: &'a str) -> TextAnalyzer<'a>`
   - `TextAnalyzer::word_count(&self) -> usize`
   - `TextAnalyzer::get_text(&self) -> &'a str`

### Expected Behavior

```rust
let text = "Hello world from Rust programming";
let analyzer = TextAnalyzer::new(text);

println!("Word count: {}", analyzer.word_count());
println!("Original text: {}", analyzer.get_text());

// Lifetime relationships
let str1 = "short";
let str2 = "much longer string";
let result = longest(str1, str2);
println!("Longest: {}", result);

let sentence = "hello world";
let first = first_word(sentence);
println!("First word: {}", first);
```

## Testing

Write tests that demonstrate:
- Functions with lifetime parameters work correctly
- Structs can hold references with proper lifetimes
- Understanding the relationship between input and output lifetimes

Focus on understanding why lifetime annotations are needed and what they mean.

## Common Lifetime Patterns

1. **Input/Output Relationship**:
   ```rust
   fn first_word<'a>(s: &'a str) -> &'a str {
       s.split_whitespace().next().unwrap_or("")
   }
   ```

2. **Multiple Input Lifetimes**:
   ```rust
   fn longest<'a>(x: &'a str, y: &'a str) -> &'a str {
       if x.len() > y.len() { x } else { y }
   }
   ```

3. **Struct with References**:
   ```rust
   struct TextAnalyzer<'a> {
       text: &'a str,
   }
   ```

## Tips

- Most lifetimes are inferred automatically
- Use explicit lifetimes when the compiler can't figure out relationships
- Lifetime parameters describe relationships, not durations
- The borrow checker ensures memory safety at compile time

## Key Learning Points

- **Reference Validity**: Lifetimes ensure references don't outlive their data
- **Lifetime Annotations**: Explicit relationships between references
- **Borrow Checker**: Compile-time memory safety verification
- **Common Patterns**: Input-output relationships and struct references 

## Bonus Challenges
